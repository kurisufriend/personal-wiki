Hi, my name is Wesley Coakley (🇯🇵  コークリー・ウェズリー) ☆ﾐ(o\*･ω･)ﾉ

I am a Software Engineer in [NVIDIA's Networking Business
Unit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/) (NBU) and a graduate of [N.C.
State University](https://ncsu.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and
another B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I also accidentally took enough courses
during my college tenure to collect my minor in mathematics on the way out the
door. My professional expertise is in *OSI Layer 3 Routing*, specifically
writing software in the control-plane for switches and Linux routers.

Learning
--------

I am intermediately fluent in [[Japanese]] (I can speak / read / write well but
many technical things are still are over my head) and have studied at
[[Japan/Sophia_University]] in Tokyo, Japan; I study some every day and hope to
pass JLPT-N1 as soon as I am allowed to take the exam. I really, really enjoy
learning and this is one of several outlets for me to express this passion.

I like to read a ton too. Technical literature excites me, as does 19th century
philosophy and [post]modernist literature. There is a very wide breadth of
things which interest me and often I will enter into new topics by researching,
reading and marking up books that touch on these ideas. I prefer physical books
to digital ones because (1) I have trouble focusing on a screen for long periods
of time and (2) it is much easier to write in a book than to take notes in a
PDF.
