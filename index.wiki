This personal wiki belongs to [WesleyCoakley](https://wesleycoakley.com) (that
is, me （⌒▽⌒）).

This is a space for organizing my thoughts and knowledge,
gathered serially throughout my day, into parallel and correlating articles
which are then neatly formatted and presented here on the Web. All opinions are
my own and all information here can only be as correct as I am. 

More about this site is considered too [SiteMeta](SiteMeta) to be writing about
on the front page.
