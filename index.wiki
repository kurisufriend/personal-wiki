This personal wiki belongs to [Wesley Coakley](https://wesleycoakley.com), also
known as [[Me]] （⌒▽⌒）

This is a personal space for organizing my thoughts and knowledge, gathered
serially throughout my day, into parallel and correlating articles which are
then neatly formatted and presented here on the Web. I'm the only one with
write access here so all opinions are my own and all information here can only
be as correct as I am. This site is generated with with love and [[!iki
ikiwiki]] but saying any more about this site on the site's own front page is
considered too [[Meta/SiteMeta]] and will be avoided at all costs.

I run a [similar personal site](https://wesleycoakley.com) which hosts my
polished articles and HOWTO guides. If you're looking to read something more
monolithic maybe then you should check out that site instead |･ω･｀) I'm writing
more all the time, and actually most of the content and inspiration for those
pages comes from my notes on this personal wiki. I'd recommend checking out one
of these few articles hosted over there which typify my style:

- [My Senior Design
  Project](https://wesleycoakley.com/Projects/my-senior-design-project-ncsu-ece484-ece485.html)
- [Approach, Design, and Implementation of my ECE306 Embedded Systems
  Project](https://wesleycoakley.com/Projects/my-embedded-ncsu-ece306-project.html)

I still haven't filled out many of the pages on this site but if you'd like to
start exploring my personal wiki some the best way is to read a little about
[[Me]] because that's who's writing this!
