Terra is a blockchain which focuses on [[Decentralized_Finance]] and which
features a number of algorithmic stablecoins, each pegged to a national /
international currency; these stablecoins facilitate transactions on the network
and, along with Terra's native token LUNA, maintain the stablecoin peg by
allowing users to [arbitrage](https://youtu.be/KqpGMoYZMhY) across currencies.

The Terra chain was developed and deployed by Terraform Labs and still many
current projects on Terra's blockchain are incubated by capital from TFL. Some
of the most notable DeFi projects on Terra are:

+ [Anchor](https://anchorprotocol.com/), a decentralized money-market offering
  20% APY on stablecoin deposits
+ [Mirror](https://mirror.finance/), which mirrors real-world stocks
+ [Pylon](https://pylon.money/), enabling project launches through crowd-funding
+ [Orion](https://orion.money/), which exports Anchor's 20% yield to other chains

... as of the time of writing these are some of the most anticipated protocols
launching on Terra.

+ [Astroport](https://astroport.fi/), Terra's next-gen AMM
+ [Mars protocol](https://marsprotocol.io/), trustless lending protocol
+ [Levana](https://levana.finance), enabling leveraged tokens and perpetuals

... I'm [[lucky to be working with Levana|Levana]] to create the first perpetual
swap protocol on Terra |･ω･｀) while it is not the first perpetual swap on
Cosmos ([Injective Protocol](https://injectiveprotocol.com/) has that title) I
believe we have a distinct advantage starting off in an ecosystem with native
stablecoins in which to quote prices and settle transactions.

Terra is built on the Cosmos SDK & the Tendermint Consensus algorithm; its smart
contracts are typically written in Rust which are then compiled down to
[CosmWasm / Web Assembly](https://github.com/CosmWasm). Recently Terra enabled
[Inter-Blockchain
Communication](https://agora.terra.money/t/proposal-enable-ibc-for-terra/2146)
to allow communication with other IBC-enabled projects like Cosmos Hub and
Osmosis.

Moving Funds onto Terra
------------------------

When I first discovered [Anchor](https://anchorprotocol.com) I was fascinated
with its 20% APY on stablecoin deposits. For reference my bank account earns
(at most) 0.15% APY, so 20% APY was mind-melting and I had to get in. To
on-board onto Terra from my bank account I had to bridge through Ethereum using
wrapped UST which was very expensive.

Now with IBC enabled I can move funds into and out of Terra very easily using
the Cosmos Hub and Osmosis.


### Obtaining ATOM

You can buy [ATOM](https://www.coinbase.com/price/cosmos) on your favorite
centralized exchange. ATOM is the native token of the Cosmos Hub and has wide
availability across exchanges.

I use Coinbase because here in the US funds clear quickly relative to a wire
transfer. You can even trade with that money *while* your funds clear which is
cool. Normally it takes 4 business days for the transfer to clear, at which
point you can continue with the next step.

### Transferring ATOM to Keplr

You should set up a
[Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en)
wallet to accept the ATOM you just bought. Remember to write down your seed
phrase and keep it somewhere safe, because this seed phrase allows you to access
your funds if you uninstall the wallet or lose your hard-drive or whatever. I
prefer to use a scheme to [split my seed phrase into 3
pieces](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/60540/practical-way-to-split-a-bip39-seed-into-a-2-out-of-3-factor-auth)
such that I only need two of the three pieces of paper to access the seed, and
it removes the single-point-of-failure that comes with only having one sheet
with all the words on it.

This wallet gives you a Cosmos hub address beginning with `cosmos...` to which
you can send the ATOM you bought on the centralized exchange. Withdraw the ATOM
from your exchange account to your Keplr wallet `cosmos...` address.

With the ATOM in your Keplr wallet, navigate to [the Omosis
DEX](https://app.osmosis.zone) and connect your Keplr wallet. Click "Assets"
then "Deposit" next to ATOM in the Osmosis UI.

[[!img img/terra-ibc-to-osmosis.png]]

Click "MAX" to transfer all the ATOM from your wallet on Cosmos Hub to your
wallet on Osmosis. Don't worry — you don't need to set up a separate Osmosis
wallet! Keplr uses the same seed phrase for all chains it supports so you
automatically have an address starting with `osmosis...` and do not need to fill
it in manually if you use the Osmosis UI.

### Swapping ATOM for UST on Osmosis

Once you've signed this transaction in the Keplr prompt that pops up you should
see the ATOM show up in the "Osmosis" section of Keplr — congratulations! You
just performed your first IBC transfer by moving ATOM from the Cosmos Hub chain
to the Osmosis chain. From here you can use the Osmosis DEX to trade ATOM to
UST. If Terra is still in "experimental" mode on Osmosis you may need to add it
by clicking the banner above the swap dialog.

*NOTE* that you'll want to exchange a small amount of ATOM for LUNA to cover the
transaction fee to move from the Keplr Terra wallet to your own Terra wallet,
normally only 12 cents worth of LUNA or so.

[[!img img/terra-osmosis-swap.png]]

Now you've traded ATOM for UST. The last step is to withdraw UST from Osmosis to
a Terra wallet. Keplr handles Terra wallets, so using the Osmosis UI again by
clicking on "Assets" and then "Withdraw" under UST should work like a charm. If
you traded for a bit of LUNA as well then transfer that now too using Osmosis'
UI.

### Moving UST to your Terra Wallet

For interacting with the Terra ecosystem you'll want to set up the [Terra
Station
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-station/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp?hl=en).
Write down this seed phrase in a similar fashion to how you recorded your Keplr
seed phrase. The difference between Keplr and Terra Station is that Station is
Terra-specific. You cannot use Keplr to interact with dApps on Terra.

Copy the Terra address you have on Terra Station and use Keplr to send UST from
your Keplr Terra wallet to your Terra wallet on Terra Station.

Finally you've got UST on Terra Station! From here the possibilities are
endless. I recommend trying out [Anchor](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/) for an
easy 20% APY on the UST you moved over under the "Earn" tab. Anchor even gives a
nice summary of how much you can expect to earn at that APY. Obviously there is
much, much more to do on Terra though!

I hope to write a bit here about my favorite protocols in the future so you can
discover the same things that have fascinated me since I've been a part of the
ecosystem.
